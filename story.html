        <p>
          If someone asks you a question “Who are you?” What shall be your answer? You will say I am ....
Either your name or your profession​. I say my name, my designation, my profession. Hence, all
these are 'mine'​, they are not 'me'​. Then Who am I? I need to understand. This is the baseline for
anything else.Life exists as a result of a union of Soul and body.Soul is not a physical light but a light of
conscious energy, the fundamental
being of experience. I am the one who
experiences this life through this body
made of 5 elements (soil, water, fire, air
and space).Just as a driver
controls a car through its control mechanisms while sitting in
the driver’s seat, the soul uses the brain to control the body.The soul has three intrinsic faculties – mind,
intellect and impressions​.</p>

          <span>God-Our Supreme Father</span>
          <p>
God is called the Supreme Soul or more accurate is that the
Supreme Soul is known to us as the God, the creator Almighty.
He is supreme among all souls. Yet, like souls, God is a subtle
point of light. But unlike human Souls, that Soul is beyond the
cycle of birth and death and the effects of Karma (actions) in
the form of experience of pleasure or pain. God is the Supreme
Father, Mother, Teacher and Guide of all human souls. We all
remember Him only in our difficult time, it is such inbuilt within
us.In Hinduism​, God is
worshipped as an oval-shaped stone called Shivlingam
or Jyotirlingam​, meaning a symbol of Shiv or symbol of
light. Muslims revere an oval-shaped black stone called
Sang-e-Aswad (holy stone), which is placed in the Kaaba
in the Grand Mosque in Mecca​. Jesus Christ
(Christianity) has said and described God as 'light '.The common is clear that '​God is a being of Light' and so is worshipped as
non-physical power.We get a name when we take birth. In
our each birth, our name is different. But what about the name of the One who never takes a
birth, is ‘unborn’! His name must be eternal. So as God has revealed Himself with His eternal

name 'Shiv' or 'Shiva' (when pronounced in English). The meaning of Shiv is '​One who isEver
Benevolent​'​. Benevolent means the One who does good to all in all times.</p>
